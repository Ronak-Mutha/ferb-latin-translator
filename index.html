        <p>Are you a fan of Phineas and Ferb? Did you know they created their own language, Ferb Latin which quickly
            catches on. To speak it you must take the first letter of every word, move it to the end, and then say
            '-erb'\; though two-letter words stay the same. Ferb Latin has non-verbal cues as well, such as reaching for
            the sky to say "okay, " cracking your knuckles to say that you're hungry, doing jazz hands when you smell
            something bad, twisting your toungue and teeth to say everything is ok, and blowing a raspberry to say
            goodbye. Use the translator to convert your text from English to Ferb Latin.</p>
